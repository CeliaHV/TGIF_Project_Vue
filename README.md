# TGIF_Project_Vue
First 2.0 Dynamic Website made it with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap & Vue.js

I've been asked to upgrade the code that I've had to use live data with AJAX, and to take advantage of Vue.

 - Vue is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework to make it easier to display data in HTML.

The first important change I've made is replacing the code that gets the test data from local files with AJAX calls to get real data from the ProPublica site instead.

The second change was following best practices and clean up the JavaScript and HTML code. One step was moving most of the JavaScript from the HTML file over into its own .js file. The other step was using Vue to reduce the amount of JavaScript needed to update the HTML.
